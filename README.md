# PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.
## Overview
PowerPulse is a machine learning-based model designed to predict household energy usage. By analyzing past energy consumption data, the model provides accurate forecasts to help users optimize energy consumption and promote sustainability. The project employs **Linear Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **Neural Networks** to achieve high accuracy, with an **R² score of 0.998**.

## Project Features
- **Energy usage prediction:** Forecast future household energy usage based on historical data.
- **Model comparison:** Utilizes and compares three machine learning models—Linear Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks.
- **High accuracy:** Achieved an R² score of **0.998** on the validation set.

 ## Models Used
1. **Linear Regression:** A basic, interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
2. **Random Forests:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and handle overfitting.
3. **Neural Networks:** A deep learning model that can capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, helping to improve prediction accuracy.

Results
Linear Regression: Achieved an R² score of 0.998 on the test set.
Random Forests: Achieved an R² score of 0.999 on the test set.
Neural Networks: Achieved an R² score of 0.999 on the test set.
Note: If you need to experiment with hyperparameters or other configurations, feel free to modify the configuration files.
